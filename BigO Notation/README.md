# Big O Definition
We say that an algorithm is O(f(n)) if the number of simple operations the computer has to do is eventually less than a constant times f(n), as n increases

f(n) could be linear (f(n) = n)
f(n) could be quadratic (f(n) = n  )
f(n) could be constant (f(n) = 1)
f(n) could be something entirely different!
